            <h4>What is Incident Response</h4>
            <p>
                An incident is any problem that disrupts normal work, like computer issues or security breaches. The response involves reporting the issue, taking steps to contain and assess the problem, updating everyone involved, fixing the problem, restoring normal operations, and documenting what happened. For regular employees, it’s important to know how to report issues and follow these steps to help keep things running smoothly.

<p>Each role within Sample Assist carries specific responsibilities based on the individual's position. These roles include lower-level employees, team leaders, and upper management. Each level is granted a certain degree of authority and corresponding actions that must be appropriately exercised in response to an incident and will be briefly demonstrated according to each role.</p>

            <h4>Lower level </h4>
            <p>
                Lower level employees would need to ensure that any suspicous events or potential incidents that they identify within the system are swiftly alerted to their team leaders for confirmation and validity. If the team leaders aren’t available or not responding, upper management would need to be contacted and informed of the suspicious activity that was encountered in extensive context to identify if the threat is a true positive or false negative.
            </p>
            <h4>Team leaders</h4>
            <p>
                As team leaders, you share the responsibilities of identifying potential incidents to the system within your sector alongside low level employees. However, as team leaders, your role includes more responsibilities such as verifying and assessing reports created from lower level employees as well as ensuring that the suspicious events identified by the lower level are true positives, and are thoroughly investigated and properly escalated based on severity. Team leaders must also provide guidance to the team in the case of an incident with proper precautions that must be warranted, and act as the main contact to the upper management department. 
            </p>
            <h4>Upper management</h4>
            <p>Upper management's main concerns and roles in relevance to incident response convey the highest level of responsibility. Their main responsibility is overseeing the main operation by ensuring that team leaders are properly selected to guide and respond to the incident while also ensuring lower level employees understand incident response protocol. When team leaders contact the upper management about an incident that has occurred, upper management must make critical decsions regarding the next steps to be taken and precautions to be developed. Passwords should also be changed for critical systems utilizing our password generator that was created to ensure enhanced password security in the case of an incident. Lastly they must review and refine the incident response strategies regularly, while also ensuring that compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards are met in relation to incident and response.</p>
