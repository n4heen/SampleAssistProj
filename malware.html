    What is it?  
    Malware (short for “malicious software”) is software that causes harm, exploits, or attempts to compromise a device's system or network. Malware is usually installed on another individual's device to steal, encrypt, or delete data, hijack computer functions, and spy on your computer’s activity without your knowledge. The different types of malware include, but are not limited to:  
    Viruses  
    A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to a supposed legitimate program or file. When this program is then executed, the virus activates, spreading to other files and programs within the same network. This virus, depending on what it was programmed to do, can corrupt, delete, or modify files and system data, causing damage to spread within the system like wildfire.  
    Trojan  
    A trojan, most famously inspired by Greek mythology, the trojan horse is essentially a type of malware that downloads onto a computer's system as a disguise. The trojan can then commit malicious actions without the user’s knowledge or identification due to it being masked.  
    Worms  
    Worms are another type of malware that replicates itself and spreads to other systems. The difference between worms and viruses, however, is that worms do not need to attach to a host file or program and operate as standalone entities. Worms also spread at a much faster capacity, infecting many devices on the network.  


    Why is it important?  

    It is important to understand the concepts of malware and other different types of malware to help individuals and organizations increase security awareness, mitigate risk, and educate employees and users of the severity of malware.  
    How do I prevent it?  
    To prevent malware from affecting your compromised system, ensure that:  
    Firewalls are enabled with proper filtering.  
    The installation of popular anti-malware software.  
    Regularly updating your operating system and applications  
    Backing up your data  
    Proper intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).  
    Educating yourself more on malware

   <section id="ransomware">
    What is it?  
    Ransomware, like malware, is malicious software developed to block access to devices, systems, and files for a specified time limit until a ransom is paid. It does this by encrypting the files, making them inaccessible to the user. The attack usually demands payment, often in cryptocurrency due to it being harder to trace, in exchange for the decryption key to unlock these files. Ransomware can usually spread through email links (phishing), malicious downloads, or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the system.  
    Why is it important?  
    The reason ransomware has its own category from malware is due to the severity it can and has had on individuals, organisations, and entire sectors. The reasons for its importance include:  
    High impact: can cause disruption of operations and halt business processes.  
    Data loss: There is no guarantee that data will be fully restored, and paying the ransom might not even be legitimate as the decryption process might fail or encourage further cybercrime.  
    Financial costs: aside from the expensive cost of ransom, business operations and processes will be on hold, productivity will be lost, and potential legal fees and recovery efforts will cost astronomically.  
    How do I prevent it?  
    In order to prevent ransoms from occurring or affecting your already compromised device, key strategies that should be implemented to protect against ransomware include:  
    Regular backups of critical data are stored in locations isolated from your network.  
    Avoid paying the ransomware, even if it seems tempting, as it is never guaranteed.  
    Consulting with the cyber security team on how to resolve the ransomware issue.  
    IDS/IPS to block malicious traffic and detect it in the act.  
    Network segmentation, which provides increased security control and limits access,.  
    Educating users about phishing and the dangers of suspicious links is crucial, as human error frequently plays a significant role in ransomware attacks.

   <section id="sqlInjection"> 
    What is it?  
    SQL (Structured Query Language) injection is a server-side cyberattack that attempts to compromise a system database through the exploitation of input fields such as login forms, search boxes, comment sections, etc. The attack attempts to inject a line of crafted SQL code to uncover private, unauthorised information stored within the system's SQL database. A common injection you’ve probably heard of is the ‘or 1=1-- which uncovers the username and password of all users within the database. The resulting SQL of that input would be SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ‘’ OR 1=1--'. You can even manipulate the SQL query to modify, delete, or even take complete control over the database.  

    Why is it important?  
    It’s important to understand what a SQL injection is, as it is one of the most common cyber-attack methods that cause harm to web applications and databases. Comprehending the severity and risk of SQL injection could prompt the user's database to implement prevention systems to minimise long-term consequences and potential financial impact, and it could even potentially gain administrative rights over an application database.  

    How do I prevent it?  
    We can prevent SQL injections by implementing various methods designed to counteract this cyberattack. Firstly, implementing input validation by creating length and data type validation can assist in identifying valid formats while also restricting certain characters. Additionally, the use of regular expressions to ensure that common SQL symbols such as ‘ and = are not used can help prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be implemented by utilising stripslashes() to remove backslashes, then, mysqli_real_escape_string() adds backslashes to escape special characters, so mysqli_real_escape_string() will add a \ before all ‘ or “. Finally, trim() removes all leading and trailing whitespace characters from the current string.

   <section id="XSS">
    What is it?  
    Cross-site scripting (XSS) is another injection-type cyberattack that is client-side. Attackers use flawed web applications to send malicious client-side code to browsers, which can usually occur when a web application does not sanitize the user's inputs used to generate outputs for browsers. There are two main types of XSS: persistent and non-persistent XSS.  

    Persistent (stored) XSS: This attack occurs when hackers inject malicious input into a web application’s database without proper sanitation. The harmful code is then displayed on web pages, potentially affecting users who view those pages. For example, malicious JavaScript code saved in a database could attack users when they view a webpage containing comments capturing there cookie ID.  

    Non-Persistent (Reflected) XSS: In this attack, malicious input is included in the URL query string and reflected by the web server back to the browser without sanitisation. This input is not stored in the database. For example, a URL containing a query string with malicious JavaScript code could be distributed, and the code would execute when the page is loaded.  

    Why is it important?  
    It's crucial to understand the importance of XSS and the different types because these types of XSS help to highlight vulnerabilities in web applications. Knowing how these exploits and attacks work allows users, developers, and security professionals to implement proper sanitisation techniques to prevent the injection of malicious code into a web server.  

    How do I prevent it?  
    Similar to SQL injection, XSS can be prevented by sanitising user input fields using functions like trim(), stripslashes(), htmlspecialchars(), and mysql_real_escape_string(). However, unlike SQL injection, XSS can also be mitigated by using secure cookie settings. Applying settings such as HttpOnly to cookies ensures that they cannot be accessed by JavaScript, which is the primary attack vector in XSS attacks, thus preventing cookie hijacking. Ensuring that cookies are properly set with the right format can counteract XSS attacks entirely.
