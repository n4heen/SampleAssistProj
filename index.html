        Context

        Sample assist is a business organisation which operates on a global scale and uses email frequently to
        communicate different types of information. They specialize in drug and alcohol testing, a field in which
        results need to be accurate and valid. They are open to being compliant with cyber secure procedures and are
        open to ideas about how they could better their product by ensuring the risk of invalidation is limited, and
        that time and money arenâ€™t wasted.

        The results produced by this company can be used in court cases to test sobriety, or used as evidence for
        medical prescriptions, and can be combined with other forms of personal information which can be used to form a
        digital identity. In any case, all employees should be made aware of the importance of the information they are
        handling and utilize cyber secure procedures to ensure that it is treated with the proper care and attention.
