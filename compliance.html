            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Europe GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</h3>
            <p> The Europe GDPR was designed to replace the previous 1995 data protection directive. GDPR is the data that allows an individual to be identified whether this personal data could be racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, genetic and biometric data, health information and data on an individual’s sex life or orientation. Hence this regulation is crucial in protecting personal data as the law covers individuals, organisations and companies that constitute personal data.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">GDPR 7 Principles</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lawfulness, Fairness and transparency</li>
                <li>Purpose limitation</li>
                <li>Data minimisation</li>

            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">
                How does this apply to Australian Organisations?
                </h3>
                <p>The European GDPR still applies to Australian Organisations when they have established a presence in the EU, such as launching a website or online presence, which means they need to comply with the regulations. Businesses should determine whether they need to comply with the GDPR and take necessary steps to ensure that personal data handling practices comply before any processes. From a healthcare perspective, compliance is essential if they handle the personal data of EU residents or offer services to them as they are protected under the GDPR law which also applies to monitoring their behaviour and data transfer internationally.
                    Another reason this applies to organisations is that EU citizens may be in Australia for various reasons such as permanent visas, temporary visas or travel visas. Personal information for these individuals will be needed such as medical history for health organisations and this information may be found across different systems and databases stored in the EU.

            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Data Encryption Standards </h3>
            <p>AES256</p>
    
            <p> Advanced Encryption Standards is a symmetric encryption algorithm best known for its high resistance to brute force attacks. This standard is used for secure data transmission and storage. AES 256 is widely used in healthcare as an encryption method for securing extensive databases that may contain patient files involving their medical histories and other personal information. This ensures that all sensitive data and information are kept confidential and prevents unauthorised access. This complies with the HIPAA standards in the lawful use and disclosure of protected health information to ensure sensitive patient information is protected and secured. AES uses symmetric key encryption meaning that it uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting data and offers 128, 192 or 256-bit key variants.

            <br>
            <p>TLS 1.2/1.3 data transit</p>
           
            <p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.2 and 1.3 are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. The main use for a TLS is to encrypt data in transit to ensure sensitive information is being transmitted securely across networks ensuring the data will be sent to the intended location without interception or tampering.</p>

            <p>Organisations should be using TLS 1.3. This is because the vulnerable cipher suites found in 1.2 have been removed and a stronger cipher suite instead. Cipher Suites is a set of algorithms to help secure a connection.</p>
<p>Cipher Suites 3 different algorithms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Key establishment for securely establishing a symmetric key between two devices</li>
    <li>Bulk encryption for encrypting traffic</li>
    <li> Message Authentication Code to ensure that the traffic is not modified in transit</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>Public Key Infrastructure</p>
      
            <p>An encryption framework uses digital certificates to protect and authenticate communications between servers and users, these include securing websites, securing email messages and securing local networks. Digital certificates provide unique digital identities to users, applications and devices.</p>

            <p>Generally, public key cryptography relies on 2 keys, one to encrypt and one to decrypt. The plaintext will be encrypted by the encryption key and encrypted into cipher text. This will be sent to the receiver, and they will need a decryption key to decode the textA certificate authority is a trusted third-party organisation that issues digital certificates to prove the corresponding certificate belongs to the certified public key. This process is important for organisations to establish trust in signatures, encryption and identities to secure websites, email signing, encryption and local networks.</p>

           <br>
           <br>
           <p>FIPS 140-2/140-3 Compliance </p>
           <p>
            FIPS, acronym for Federal Information Processing Standard, are guidelines released by NIST, outlining document processing, various encryption algorithms, and techniques for safeguarding sensitive information both physically and digitally. Verifying that cryptographic modules utilised to protect health data adhere to FIPS 140-2/140-3 standards ensures they meet strict global security criteria. It is crucial to ensure that patient information is protected from unauthorised access by encrypting data to the highest standards during both transit and at rest. Adhering to this requirement is crucial. Australian healthcare institutions demonstrate their commitment to safeguarding patient data and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive health information through adherence to FIPS 140-2/140-3 regulations. Adherence to these standards guarantees that encryption methods meet strict security criteria, especially in safeguarding health data from unauthorised breaches and access. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Secure Cloud Storage</p>
<p>
Secure cloud storage involves storing data on remote servers accessible online while ensuring protection against loss, theft, and unauthorised access. Common security measures in cloud storage include robust access controls, encryption, authentication processes, regular security assessments, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Health information stored in the cloud needs to be safeguarded from unauthorised access, loss, or exposure following Australian laws, such as the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). When managing confidential medical information, cloud storage options must comply with FIPS 140-2/140-3 regulations to ensure encryption keys and cryptographic processes are secure and meet rigorous protection criteria.
