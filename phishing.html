            What is it?
Generally referred to as a form of social engineering where attackers send fraudulent communications that appear to be from legitimate and reputable sources in the form of email and text messages. The goal of this is to gain login information to access sensitive information and monetary gain. Sometimes attackers could even persuade the target to install malware onto their devices.

Different types
There are different types of phishing emails, commonly known are Spear Phishing and Whale Phishing.
Spear Phishing: Refers to targeting a specific individual, group, or organization. These types of attacks involve manipulation through fake stories and made-up scenarios. These attackers will generally conduct research before the attack. This phishing attack can take the form of email, text, and phone calls.
Whale Phishing: Like Spear phishing attackers target directly high-level executives pretending to be legitimate, known, and trusted entities, for example, a company’s CEO to encourage the victims to share highly sensitive data and information.

Why is this important?
It is important to understand the nature of Phishing Scams to help prevent data loss and financial losses. According to Forbes, in 2022 there were 300,497 phishing victims with a total loss of $52,089,159 in the United States alone. This is only the attacks being reported and more unreported from individuals or small companies who don’t want to report financial losses to lose their reputation. These attacks can be prevented from understanding how they work and why they work.
 
Why is it so effective? 
This is because Phishing attacks mainly exploit human vulnerabilities, with trust, curiosity, and the nature to respond to messages. With Phishing emails being abundantly available through the dark web or simply online it is not difficult to send one. Hence why it is important to be well-informed and trained about these types of Phishing attacks to help quickly identify and terminate these suspicious emails or calls.
 
 
How does it work?
Phishing Scams generally trick their targets by sending legitimate-looking emails that could be with a real company logo, name, and email address. Malicious links or files could sometimes be sent with emails to persuade the target to click on them to download malware onto the target's computer.
Examples of this could be an email sent to an employee of a company pretending to be the CEO.  They stated that the employee service page is under maintenance and errors occur and needed the employee’s login details to help fix it. With the urgency and trustability of the email, the employee would most like to hand the details over. Resulting in the malicious attacker gaining access to the company data.
