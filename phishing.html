            What is it?
Generally referred to as a form of social engineering where attackers send fraudulent communications that appear to be from legitimate and reputable sources in the form of email and text messages. The goal of this is to gain login information to access sensitive information and monetary gain. Sometimes attackers could even persuade the target to install malware onto their devices.

Different types
There are different types of phishing emails, commonly known are Spear Phishing and Whale Phishing.
Spear Phishing: Refers to targeting a specific individual, group, or organization. These types of attacks involve manipulation through fake stories and made-up scenarios. These attackers will generally conduct research before the attack. This phishing attack can take the form of email, text, and phone calls.
Whale Phishing: Like Spear phishing attackers target directly high-level executives pretending to be legitimate, known, and trusted entities, for example, a company’s CEO to encourage the victims to share highly sensitive data and information.

Why is this important?
It is important to understand the nature of Phishing Scams to help prevent data loss and financial losses. According to Forbes, in 2022 there were 300,497 phishing victims with a total loss of $52,089,159 in the United States alone. This is only the attacks being reported and more unreported from individuals or small companies who don’t want to report financial losses to lose their reputation. These attacks can be prevented from understanding how they work and why they work.
 
Why is it so effective? 
This is because Phishing attacks mainly exploit human vulnerabilities, with trust, curiosity, and the nature to respond to messages. With Phishing emails being abundantly available through the dark web or simply online it is not difficult to send one. Hence why it is important to be well-informed and trained about these types of Phishing attacks to help quickly identify and terminate these suspicious emails or calls.
 
 
How does it work?
Phishing Scams generally trick their targets by sending legitimate-looking emails that could be with a real company logo, name, and email address. Malicious links or files could sometimes be sent with emails to persuade the target to click on them to download malware onto the target's computer.
Examples of this could be an email sent to an employee of a company pretending to be the CEO.  They stated that the employee service page is under maintenance and errors occur and needed the employee’s login details to help fix it. With the urgency and trustability of the email, the employee would most like to hand the details over. Resulting in the malicious attacker gaining access to the company data.

            Spear Phishing: Refers to targeting a specific individual, group, or organization. These types of attacks involve manipulation through fake stories and made-up scenarios. These attackers will generally conduct research before the attack. This phishing attack can take the form of email, text, and phone calls.

How does spear phishing work?
Defining a goal of the attack: this could be for financial gain, company information, customer information and other sensitive data.
Choosing the target: Spear phishing focuses on a target so finding a target to scam could be from social media, internet or on the other media profile platforms.
Research on the target: After the target has been set, research through their social media such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedLn will assist in the phishing email such as finding the target's email or phone number.
Creating the spear phishing email: Using the information gathered a spear phishing email can be made using various social engineering techniques.

How does the attacker get your information?
Common methods phishers can find targets from social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and TikTok. Information such as emails, phone numbers, friends, family and places you have gone to such as frequent visits can be easily accessible through online platforms. 
With this information phishers can personalise the phishing email with a legitimate looking logo of the shop the target has been to or a brand they purchased from. Pretending to be them and sending an email with names, links and images appearing to be the “real deal”. These fake emails could be impersonating the target's bank, insurance company or health care company with a link to let the target click on. This link could either be downloading malware or a link to a fake website that makes the victim enter their credentials. This could lead to attackers hijacking or gaining access to the computers resulting in compromised data or denial of service attacks.




How to identify a spear phishing scam?
Below are indicators that could be a spear phishing email:
The email is sent with an emergency or urgent tone: hoping the recipient will act rashly and not suspect the sender. Whilst asking to login via a link or send sensitive credentials.
 Incorrect Email address: Such as the Domain or the format is unusual.
Grammar and Spelling mistakes
The Email is asking for sensitive information or personal details 
Links seem to be incorrect spelling or format.
Unsolicited attachments such as suspicious files 
Pretexting. For example, your login credentials have expired.

Common Preventions 
Employee Awareness Training: Awareness training can help employees to be more educated in phishing scams and can identify whether the email is a scam or not.
Multi Factor Authentication: An extra step in authentication to ensure the person accessing the system is the intended person.
Email Scanning: A process to scan email for virus, malware or other malicious files/links.
Software updates and patches: Ensuring the system is up to date and no vulnerabilities are being exploited.
Email Filtering: organising emails into categories such as types, important and spam.

            Emails 

            Emails are the most common delivery method for attackers. Knowing how emails work will help you distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones, whether in your personal life or at work. As the image demonstrates, all it takes is one click on a malicious email, and suddenly, you've given a hacker access to the company's private network.
            
            
            
            
            
            Types emails 
            
            Spam email
            
            Spam emails, or "junk mail," are unsolicited and unwanted messages that aren't always harmful. Examples include:
            
            Newsletters the user unknowingly subscribed to
            Marketing emails promoting products and services
            Updates from companies or services the user has registered with
            
            You can easily see on of them b just going to ur junk email 
            
            
            
            Recon Emails
            
            Recon emails are used to check if the destination mailbox is in use so that it can be targeted in future phishing attacks. Recon emails can vary in sophistication, there are three types we tend to see in the real world:
            
            Spam recon: emails are sent to see if they get a response, like an "undeliverable" error. If no error is received, it means the email was delivered and the mailbox is in use. For example, if you send a blank email to an inactive Gmail address, you might get an "undeliverable" message.
            
            Social Engineering Recon Emails: These emails use social engineering, like pretending to be someone the recipient knows, to get a response. They might also create a sense of urgency, such as asking if meeting notes have been read before an important meeting, which can make people act quickly without thinking.
            
            
            
            
            Email spoofing 
            If you get an unexpected or unusual email asking you to click a link or download something, it might be a case of email spoofing.
            
            
            Sender spoofing makes the email address appear as if it's from a legitimate sender, tricking recipients into thinking the email is genuine. This increases the chances that the recipient will open malicious attachments, click harmful links, or enter credentials on a fake login page. It’s a common tactic used to deceive users.
            
            A common spoofing example is sending a fake email that looks like it's from IT support, asking the user to reset their password. The user clicks the link, which leads to a fake password reset page. When they enter their credentials, the information is sent to the attacker.
            
            A simple way to detect email spoofing is to check the "Reply-to" address. For example, if you receive an email that looks like it's from contact@amazon.com, but when you reply, your response is actually sent to hacktheplanet@gmail.com, that’s a red flag. This means the email wasn’t really from Amazon, but from someone pretending to be Amazon. The attacker receives your reply at hacktheplanet@gmail.com, even though the email appeared to come from a legitimate address.

        <section id="vishing">
            What is it?
            Vishing short for voice phishing is a social engineering attack that focuses on phone calls or voice messages that attempts to manipulate users into believing that the vish is trustworthy and tricks users into revealing sensitive information such:
            <ul>
           <li> Login credentials</li>
           <li>  Credit card information </li>
           <li>  Bank details</li>
           <li>  Personal information such as passport or licence information</li>
        </ul>
            This type of scam can be executed by scammers or pre-recorded bots known as a robocall. They will attempt to use psychological techniques and procedures to reveal this information such as impersonating a bank, police or even an internet provider to reveal your sensitive information.
            
            Scenario
            I will now guide you through a potential simulated scenario that illustrates what a vishing attempt might look like:
            
            Mp4 player
            “Hello my name is Frank Stevo, a representative at ……….. banking, it seems your bank account has been frozen due to suspicious activity with an unusual transaction. We will need your personal information and credit card information right this instant or we will be forced to cancel your credit card permantely. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause but we will need your prompt attention to this matter.

        <section id="whaling">
            What is it?
            Whaling is another form of social engineering phishing attack whose main targets are high executives. 
            
            
            Difference between Whale and Spear Phishing 
            
            The main differences between Spear phishing and whale phishing are the difference in targets. Whale phishing aims for higher executives in a business as they will have more value once successful. Information that could be gathered will be worth more than a regular spear phishing email, involving higher level of payments or information. Whale phishing attackers are generally disguised as peers in the same organisation, or an equal or high level of colleague or within a different organisation. Higher level of attack could involve hijacking a trusted email and sending a phishing email to create authenticity.
            
            Content within the phishing email also differs from a spear phishing email, as whale phishing targets a higher status email are personalised and extensive research is done to create a more legitimate email. This information of the target is commonly done through gathering information on social media and other similar platforms.
            
            
            Who do they target?
            High level executives such as:
            
            CEO : Chief Executive Office 
            CFO : Chief Financial Officer 
            COO : Chief Operating Officer 
            CIO : Chief Information Officer 
            
            
            Strategies They Use
            
            Spoofing Email Domains: Used by attackers when they cant hijack or hack into an email account, used to create a look alike email domain.
            
            Emergency or urgent tone: hoping the recipient will act rashly and not suspect the sender.
            Voice Phishing backups: Attackers can use vishing calls with numbers placed within the emails so once called by the victim attackers to follow up or as back up to create legitimacy.
            
            What is their goal?
            Main goals of whale phishing include:
            Monetary gain: having the victim send a large sum of corporate money.
            Gaining confidential information: information involving trades, client data or credentials.
            Gaining Access: access to secure systems, network or databases.
            Executing unauthorised actions: leading to operations to be compromised.
            
            Consequences 
            Data loss 
            Financial loss
            Disruption of Operations: Reduces productively and loss of business opportunities.
