            <h4> What is it?</h4>
            <p> Generally referred to as a form of social engineering where attackers send fraudulent communications
                that appear to be from legitimate and reputable sources in the form of email and text messages. The goal
                of this is to gain login information to access sensitive information and monetary gain. Sometimes
                attackers could even persuade the target to install malware onto their devices.</p>


            <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
            <p> It is important to understand the nature of Phishing Scams to help prevent data loss and financial
                losses. According to Forbes, in 2022 there were 300,497 phishing victims with a total loss of
                $52,089,159 in the United States alone. This is only the attacks being reported and more unreported from
                individuals or small companies who don’t want to report financial losses to lose their reputation. These
                attacks can be prevented from understanding how they work and why they work.
            </p>
            <h4>Why is it so effective?</h4>
            <p> This is because Phishing attacks mainly exploit human vulnerabilities, with trust, curiosity, and the
                nature to respond to messages. With Phishing emails being abundantly available through the dark web or
                simply online it is not difficult to send one. Hence why it is important to be well-informed and trained
                about these types of Phishing attacks to help quickly identify and terminate these suspicious emails or
                calls. </p>
            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p> Phishing Scams generally trick their targets by sending legitimate-looking emails that could be with a
                real company logo, name, and email address. Malicious links or files could sometimes be sent with emails
                to persuade the target to click on them to download malware onto the target's computer. </p>
            <p>
                Examples of this could be an email sent to an employee of a company pretending to be the CEO. They
                stated that the employee service page is under maintenance and errors occur and needed the employee’s
                login details to help fix it. With the urgency and trustability of the email, the employee would most
                like to hand the details over. Resulting in the malicious attacker gaining access to the company data.

        <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="spearPhishing">
            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Spear Phishing</h3>
            <p> Spear Phishing: Refers to targeting a specific individual, group, or organization. These types of
                attacks involve manipulation through fake stories and made-up scenarios. These attackers will generally
                conduct research before the attack. This phishing attack can take the form of email, text, and phone
                calls.</p>


            <h4>How does spear phishing work?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Defining a goal of the attack: this could be for financial gain, company information, customer
                    information and other sensitive data.</li>
                <li>Choosing the target: Spear phishing focuses on a target so finding a target to scam could be from
                    social media, the internet or on other media profile platforms.</li>
                <li>Research on the target: After the target has been set, research through social media such as
                    Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn will assist in the phishing email such as finding the target's
                    email or phone number.</li>
                <li>Creating the spear phishing email: Using the information gathered a spear phishing email can be made
                    using various social engineering techniques.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>How does the attacker get your information?</h4>
            <p> Common methods phishers can find targets are from social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook,
                LinkedIn and TikTok. Information such as emails, phone numbers, friends, family and places you have gone
                to such as frequent visits can be easily accessible through online platforms.
            </p>

            <p> With this information, phishers can personalize the phishing email with a legitimate-looking logo of the
                shop the target has been to or a brand they purchased from. Pretending to be them and sending an email
                with names, links and images appearing to be the “real deal”. These fake emails could be impersonating
                the target's bank, insurance company or health care company with a link to let the target click on. This
                link could either be downloading malware or a link to a fake website that makes the victim enter their
                credentials. This could lead to attackers hijacking or gaining access to the computers resulting in
                compromised data or denial of service attacks. </p>
            <h4>How to identify a spear phishing scam?</h4>
            <p> Below are indicators that could be a spear phishing email:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The email is sent with an emergency or urgent tone: hoping the recipient will act rashly and not
                    suspect the sender. Whilst asking to log in via a link or send sensitive credentials.</li>
                <li>Incorrect Email address: Such as the Domain or the format is unusual.</li>
                <li>Grammar and Spelling mistakes</li>
                <li>The Email is asking for sensitive information or personal details </li>
                <li>Links seem to have incorrect spelling or format.</li>
                <li>Unsolicited attachments such as suspicious files </li>
                <li>Pretexting. For example, your login credentials have expired.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Spear Phishing Attachments</h4>
            <p>Attachments can be grouped into three categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-malicious files used for social engineering (like invoices, letters, or images)</li>
                <li>Non-malicious files with malicious links (like PDFs containing links to harmful sites)
                </li>
                <li>Malicious files (like scripts or Office documents with malicious macros)</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Microsoft Office document macros</h4>
            <p>
                A macro is a series of commands used to automate repeated tasks, such as when you open a Microsoft
                Office document like Word or Excel. By default, macros are disabled, so malicious code won't run unless
                the user enables them. Microsoft Office will always notify you if the file you're opening contains
                macros. It's recommended not to enable them, as shown in the image. We'll discuss what to do if you
                encounter one in the incident response section.
            </p>
            <p>When a user opens an attachment, like a Microsoft Office document, executable file, PDF, or archive, the
                attacker's code can exploit a vulnerability or run directly on the system, especially if the user
                bypasses any security warnings.</p>

            <h4>Spear Fishing Link</h4>
            <p>A hyperlink is a web page URL embedded in text, a button, or an image. When clicked, it opens the user's
                default browser and directs them to a specific webpage. Attackers use hyperlinks to lead targets to
                malicious downloads, fake login pages for stealing credentials, or other phishing content. Hyperlinks
                can be used by attackers in different techniques like redirecting to Typo squatted domain name by
                misspelling it or using URL shorteners to hide the true destination of the link.
            </p>

            <h4>Common Preventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Employee Awareness Training: Awareness training can help employees to be more educated about
                    phishing scams and can identify whether the email is a scam or not.</li>
                <li>Multi-Factor Authentication: An extra step in authentication to ensure the person accessing the
                    system is the intended person.</li>
                <li>Email Scanning: A process to scan email for viruses, malware or other malicious files/links.</li>
                <li>Software updates and patches: Ensuring the system is up to date and no vulnerabilities are being
                    exploited.</li>
                <li>Email Filtering: Organizing emails into categories such as types, important and spam.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Whale Phishing</h3>

            <h4>Difference between Whale and Spear Phishing </h4>
            <p>The main difference between Spear phishing and whale phishing is the difference in targets. Whale
                phishing aims for higher executives in a business as they will have more value once successful.
                Information that could be gathered will be worth more than a regular spear phishing email, involving a
                higher level of payments or information. Whale phishing attackers are generally disguised as peers in
                the same organization, or an equal or high level of colleague or within a different organization. A
                higher level of attack could involve hijacking a trusted email and sending a phishing email to create
                authenticity.</p>

            <p>Content within the phishing email also differs from a spear phishing email, as whale phishing targets
                higher status emails are personalized and extensive research is done to create a more legitimate email.
                This information of the target is commonly done through gathering information on social media and other
                similar platforms.</p>

            <h4>Who do they target?</h4>
            <p>High level executives such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CEO : Chief Executive Officer</li>
                <li>CFO : Chief Financial Officer </li>
                <li>COO : Chief Operating Officer </li>
                <li>CIO : Chief Information Officer </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Strategies they use</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Spoofing Email Domains: Used by attackers when they can't hijack or hack into an email account, used
                    to create a look-alike email domain.</li>
                <li>Emergency or urgent tone: hoping the recipient will act rashly and not suspect the sender.</li>
                <li>Voice Phishing backups: Attackers can use vishing calls with numbers placed within the emails so
                    once called by the victim attackers to follow up or as backup to create legitimacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What is their goal?</h4>
            <p>The main goals of whale phishing include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monetary gain: having the victim send a large sum of corporate money.</li>
                <li>Gaining confidential information: information involving trades, client data or credentials.</li>
                <li>Gaining Access: access to secure systems, networks or databases.</li>
                <li>Executing unauthorized actions: leading to operations being compromised.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consequences</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data loss</li>
                <li>Financial loss</li>
                <li>Disruption of Operation: stopping or decreasing productivity.</li>
                <li>Damage in Reputations: losing trust from the public or potential vendors as a result of bad
                    practice.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Vishing(voice)</h3>
            <h4> What is it?</h4>
            <p> Vishing short for voice phishing is a social engineering attack that focuses on phone calls or voice
                messages that attempt to manipulate users into believing that the vish is trustworthy and tricks users
                into revealing sensitive information such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Login credentials</li>
                <li>Credit card information </li>
                <li>Bank details</li>
                <li>Personal information such as passport or license information</li>

            </ul>
            <p>This type of scam can be executed by scammers or pre-recorded bots known as a robocall. They will attempt
                to use psychological techniques and procedures to reveal this information such as impersonating a bank,
                police or even an internet provider to reveal your sensitive information.</p>
            <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
            <p> It is important to understand the nature of Phishing Scams to help prevent data loss and financial
                losses. According to Forbes, in 2022 there were 300,497 phishing victims with a total loss of
                $52,089,159 in the United States alone. This is only the attacks being reported and more unreported from
                individuals or small companies who don’t want to report financial losses to lose their reputation. These
                attacks can be prevented from understanding how they work and why they work.
            </p>
            <h4>Scenario</h4>
            <p> I will now guide you through a potential simulated scenario that illustrates what a phishing attempt
                might look like: </p>

            <p> “Hello my name is Frank Stevo, a representative at ……….. banking, it seems your bank account has been
                frozen due to suspicious activity with an unusual transaction. We will need your personal information
                and credit card information right this instant or we will be forced to cancel your credit card
                permanently. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but we will need your prompt attention to
                this matter”.</p>

            <h4>Common types of vishing scam include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-Recorded Messages: Normally has a pre-recorded human or a robotic voice.
                </li>
                <li>Creating a sense of urgency: Making an emergency or urgent atmosphere to make the victim overlook
                    the possibility it may be a scam.
                </li>
                <li>Asks for Sensitive Information: Asking for passwords, addresses or any sensitive information are red
                    flag of being a scam.</li>
                <li>Claiming to be calling from a Federal Agency </li>
            </ul>
